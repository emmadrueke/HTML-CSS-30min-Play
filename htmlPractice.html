        <p class="bodak">Said little bitch, you can't fuck with me
          If you wanted to
          These expensive, these is red bottoms
          These is bloody shoes
          Hit the store, I can get 'em both
          I don't wanna choose
          And I'm quick, cut a nigga off
          So don't get comfortable
          Look, I don't dance now
          I make money moves
          Say I don't gotta dance
          I make money move
          If I see you and I don't speak
          That means I don't fuck with you
          I'm a boss, you a worker bitch
          I make bloody moves
          Now she says she gon' do what to who?
          Let's find out and see, Cardi B
          You know where I'm at
          You know where I be
          You in the club just to party
          I'm there, I get paid a fee
          I be in and out them banks so much
          I know they're tired of me
          Honestly, don't give a fuck
          'Bout who ain't fond of me
          Dropped two mixtapes in six months
          What bitchâ€¦
